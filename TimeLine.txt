This is an aggressive timeline, but definitely achievable if you treat it like a full-time bootcamp.

To finish this 43-video course in 14 days, you will need to commit roughly 4 to 6 hours per day.

Here is your 2-Week "LLM Bootcamp" Schedule.

Week 1: The Architecture (The Hardest Part)
Your goal this week is to build the untrained "brain" of the model.

Day 1: Data Preparation (Videos 1-5)

Focus: Tokenization, sliding windows, and creating input/target pairs (torch.utils.data.DataLoader).

Goal: Can you feed text into a script and get batches of token IDs out?

Day 2: Embeddings & Positional Encoding (Videos 6-9)

Focus: Turning token IDs into vectors. Understanding why "dog bites man" is different from "man bites dog" (position matters).

Day 3: Attention Mechanism Part 1 (Videos 10-13)

Focus: Self-Attention. This is the most important concept in modern AI.

Mental Check: Do not rush this. If you don't understand Query, Key, and Value, the rest won't make sense.

Day 4: Attention Mechanism Part 2 (Videos 14-17)

Focus: Causal Attention (masking future words) and Multi-Head Attention.

Goal: Code the MultiHeadAttention class in PyTorch.

Day 5: Building the Transformer Block (Videos 18-21)

Focus: Layer Normalization, Feed Forward Networks, and GELU activation. Assemble the blocks.

Day 6: The Full GPT Model (Videos 22-25)

Focus: Connecting the blocks with skip connections (residuals). Finalizing the GPTModel class.

Milestone: You should have a model that can take input and produce (random) output without crashing.

Day 7: Buffer / Debugging Day

Focus: Fix any shape errors. Review the math. Rest your brain briefly.

Week 2: Training & Fine-Tuning (The Fun Part)
Your goal this week is to make the model actually smart.

Day 8: The Pre-Training Loop (Videos 26-29)

Focus: Writing the training function, calculating Cross-Entropy Loss, and backpropagation.

Day 9: Text Generation Strategies (Videos 30-32)

Focus: How to sample text. Temperature, Top-k, Top-p sampling.

Day 10: Loading Pre-trained Weights (Videos 33-35)

Focus: Instead of spending $1M to train from scratch, load OpenAI’s GPT-2 weights into your architecture.

Day 11: Fine-Tuning for Classification (Videos 36-38)

Focus: Adapting the model to detect spam or classify sentiment.

Day 12: Instruction Fine-Tuning Part 1 (Videos 39-40)

Focus: Preparing dataset (Alpaca style) to make the model follow commands.

Day 13: Instruction Fine-Tuning Part 2 (Videos 41-43)

Focus: The final training run. Evaluating the chatbot.

Day 14: Final Project Polish

Focus: Wrap it in a simple script or notebook. Document what you learned.
